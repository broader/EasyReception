"""Karrigell extension modulesEach extension is saved as a separate python script.Each script should define a class as follows:# You will generally want to import k_target.Target# to access its methods from k_target import Target# import other modules as requiredimport urlparseclass action:    def __init__(self, target):        # target is 'self' from the current target object        self.target = target            def __call__(self, <args>):        # the work happens here ...        # if you need values from the active target object         # created in k_target, use self.target.xxx        # e.g. self.target.script_url        #      self.target.handlerk_target.py will add a new built-in function tothe Karrigell function namespace. This makes it availablefor use in user scripts as a function with the same name as the python script.See other scripts in the extensions directory for examples."""
