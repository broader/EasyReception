This tutorial will explain step by step how to get started with <a href="http://karrigell.sourceforge.net">Karrigell</a>, a simple yet full-featured, 100% Python web framework

<p>We will begin by the installation of Karrigell ; then I will explain how you can build a simple web site managing a database with only two lines of Python code. Starting from this example, you will see you how to write concise, clear Python code to build dynamic web sites

<p>The key word for the development of Karrigell is simplicity :
<ul>
<li>the packages comes with "batteries included" : a web server and a database engine, in less than 1 MB of code
<li>no configuration : just unzip the package, install the database engine, start the server and go !
<li>programs are either pure Python, or a mix of Python and HTML <I>a la</I> PHP ; there is no templating syntax, requiring to learn a custom tags syntax
</ul>

<p>People who discover Karrigell are often surprised by this simplicity, and might think of it as a toy, only suited for an introduction and perhaps education on dynamic web servers. In fact, it lets you do the simple things in a simple way : if you want to write the proverbial "Hello, world !" program, all you have to type is

<p><blockquote><code>print "Hello, world !"</code></blockquote>

<p>But if you take a look at the documentation you might be surprised to see what the "toy" can do :
<ul>
<li>easy access to HTML forms (that is, with minimum typing)
<li>inclusion of scripts inside other scripts
<li>very simple in-memory session management
<li>basic HTTP authentication
<li>HTTP redirection
<li>protection of directories (only accessible to authenticated users)
<li>a web interface to enter the translation of dynamic pages
<li>a variety of programming styles, from pure Python with a whole site in one script to PHP-like, one-script-for-each-page style
<li>a very powerful asynchronous built-in web server
<li>virtual hosts
<li>gzip support
<li>the ability to run behind Apache or Xitami
<li>a very clear and complete debugger
</ul>
and much more...

But let's begin by <a href="tut1.html">the beginning</a> : downloading and installing the program
