<h1><%= chapter %>. Introduction</h1>
Karrigell is a flexible Python web framework, with a clear and intuitive syntax. 
It is independant from any database, ORM or templating engine, and lets the 
programmer choose between a variety of coding styles 

<p>It applies to web programming what Python applies to programming : simple,
clear, easy to code and to maintain. To achieve this, Karrigell scripts are
essentially normal Python scripts, run in a namespace that provides all the environment
needed in a web application : form field values, HTTP request headers, cookies, etc.
The namespace also provides functions to manage sessions, localization, user
profile, etc

<p>The best way to run Karrigell is with the built-in multi-threaded web server :
it's fast, reliable and allows for maximum speed and flexibility for programming,
session management, maintaining database connections across requests, etc. 
It can also be easily integrated behind Apache : basic CGI integration, or
with mod_python for better performance. All popular databases 
(sqlite, MySql, PostGresQL, etc)  can be used with the corresponding Python API's

<p>A complete documentation, with many demos including a blog engine, a forum and
a wiki, will help programers to get started
