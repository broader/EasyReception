	Overview
	========
	Karrigell is a flexible web programming solution in Python...

	The easiest way to use Karrigell is to run it as a standalone application, with a built-in web server. For Windows users, an executable is provided so that the whole application, including a Python interpreter with the SQLite database, can be started with a double-click and no configuration on any machine or from a USB key

	Installing behind an Apache server is also very simple, either as a site administrator or in a shared web hosting situation : a preconfigured version of Karrigell is provided as a tarball, all you have to do is to decompress its content in the Document Root and choose the way you want to integrate server and framework : plain CGI mode or with mod_python. The choice only means that you have to change the name of one file !

	The programing style follows the same philosophy of simplicity : all the programer needs to know is Python and HTML - no templating language is imposed - and a few built-in names defined by the framework. Scripts are executed in a namepace including environment data, user input, built-in functions for session management, user authentication, redirection, etc

	The recommanded way to create programs is to use "Karrigell services", which are pure Python scripts where functions map urls :

	(example)

	Associated with the built-in module HTMLTags which generates HTML from Python code, Karrigell programs have the same clean structure as all Python scripts. For programers who are more at ease with PHP-like scripts - HTML code with Python code inserted inside special tags <% %> - the Python Inside HTML format is available
